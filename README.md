# Loan-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression_Small-Dataset
üè¶ Loan Prediction Model

This repository contains a simple machine-learning pipeline to predict loan approval (loan_status) from applicant data. The README below is generated after inspecting the notebook and dataset you uploaded ‚Äî it reflects what the notebook actually does (no invented steps).

Project summary

Dataset shape: 61 rows √ó 8 columns.

Target column: loan_status.

Preprocessing performed: only pd.get_dummies() (one‚Äëhot encoding) to convert categorical features into numeric features. No exploratory data analysis (EDA) or feature engineering was performed.

Model used: LogisticRegression from scikit-learn (the notebook defines and fits a LogisticRegression estimator).

Evaluation: 5-fold cross-validation using cross_val_score.

Dataset (columns)

The CSV contains the following columns (as found in loan.csv):

age

gender

occupation
